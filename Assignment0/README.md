>We were asked to list **five** topics that we found interesting. I've been thinking a lot about intrinsic motivation,
> and these are some topics that drive my interests.


1. Related to data and structures, there are some interesting compression algorithms that I would investigate
   if I wasn't tied up with math/cs coursework. I like the idea of replacing repetitive things and efficiency.
2. Having only read briefly about data structures, my understanding isn't rock solid, but [Van Emde Boas (VEB) trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Emde_Boas_tree)
   and other more advanced structures are fascinating. I'm always blown away by the intelligence and ingenuity of
   people like Adriaan van Emde Boas and at the fact they existed in my lifetime; with modern access to information, it's
   easier than ever to appreciate without more experience in number theory, complexity analysis, recursion, etc.
3. All this buzz about AI and data makes me realize I'd like to know more about machine learning techniques and
   statistics -- I'd like to be able to follow the conversation without pretending like I know what's going on. I'm curious about how technology can be used for educational purposes; for example,
   how difficult topics can be scaffolded by an "AI" expert. I was very much a **_but why_** kid growing up; each answer prompted a followup. These trained language models have the power
   to help in that regard and can provide a lot of background information and analogies tailored by a students
   own reflection on their gaps of knowledge.
4. I'm interested in learning more about pointers and the *strangeness* with ```c++```'s implementations that were
   hinted to in class. I'm hoping that knowledge will help clarify calls, ABI specifications, and other topics from 
   lower level programming classes.
5. I'm interested in putting a meaning behind a lot of the data structures buzzwords and really figuring out why some
 of these things work. In past discrete math classes, I would have to sit for hours with a whiteboard trying to figure
 out why a theorem, proof, or algorithm held up. While brutal in the moment, it's like anything challenging, you feel 
 a sense of accomplishment and pride after that 'a-ha' moment when the infinite series proof lands or when you hear the powerset of 
 the powerset of the powerset of an empty set and can make sense of why there's subsets of empty sets in absurd looking notation.

>We were asked to list five topics that are difficult, either from experience or our own reasoning.

1. Generators and using them effectively for non-trivial tasks (my immediate goal is using recursion with 'yield' in
   python.)
2. Designing/analyzing algorithms and implementing them in C/C++.
3. Theory of computing in general, automata, computability, complexity theory, algorithms, languages, etc.
4. Parallelism (cloud and stuff like data mining) and understanding what's going on at the hardware/software level.
5. Operating systems, perhaps simply because I've always been intimidated by the expertise and knowledge of the
   adults when I was a kid, those that were around during the real renaissance moments of computing. Growing up in the 90s, my 
   Macintosh IIci was bigger than the world, a ~~black~~ white box of hollywood style hacking intrigue. Operating systems and the
   coding for a certain ISA never really lost its mystique. The stakes were high, and they were the players, and it felt
   like I would have had to have been a teenager in the late 1970s to ride that wave in.
