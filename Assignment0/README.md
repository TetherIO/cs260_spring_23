>We were asked to list **five** topics that we found interesting. I've been thinking a lot about intrinsic motivation,
> and these are some topics that drive my interests.


1. Related to data and structures, There are some cool-looking compression algorithms that I would probably investigate
   if I wasn't tied up with the math/cs coursework. I like the idea of replacing repetitive things and efficiency.
2. Having only read briefly about data structures, my understanding isn't rock solid, but [Van Emde Boas (VEB) trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Emde_Boas_tree)
   and other more advanced structures are fascinating. I'm always blown away by the intelligence and ingenuity of
   people like Adriaan van Emde Boas and at the fact they existed in my lifetime; with modern access to information, it's
   easier than ever to appreciate without more experience in number theory, complexity analysis, recursion, etc.
3. All this buzz about AI and data makes me realize I'd like to know more about machine learning techniques and
   statistics -- I'd like to be able to follow the conversation without pretending like I know what's going on.
4. I'm interested in learning more about pointers and the *strangeness* with ```c++```'s implementations that were
   hinted to in class. I'm hoping that knowledge will help clarify calls, ABI specifications, and other topics from 
   lower level programming classes.
5. Perhaps not directly related to our course, I'm curious about how technology can be used for educational purposes; for example,
   how difficult topics can be scaffolded by an "AI" expert. I was very much
   a **_but why_** kid growing up; each answer prompted a followup. These trained language models have the power
   to help in that regard and can provide a lot of background information and analogies tailored by a students
   own reflection on their gaps of knowledge. Is AI the end all? My apprehension about trusting the next big tech is
   rooted in the fact that funding relies on stimulating the imagination with short term predictions that seem almost
   impossible... self-driving cars, quantum computers that run like my gaming pc, human-like AI etc. That said, as a kind
   of interactive wikipedia resource, these chat models seem pretty amazing... as an outright replacement for a software
   developer, I think that's going to be far, if ever, in the future.

>We were asked to list five topics that are difficult, either from experience or our own reasoning.

1. Generators and using them effectively for non-trivial tasks (my immediate goal is using recursion with 'yield' in
   python.)
2. Designing/analyzing algorithms and implementing them in some programming language.
3. Theory of computing in general, automata, computability, complexity theory, algorithms, languages, etc.
4. Parallelism (cloud and stuff like data mining) and understanding what's going on at the hardware/software level.
5. Operating systems, perhaps simply because I've always been intimidated by the expertise and knowledge of the
   people that were around when the 8086 droppped. Growing up in the 90s, my home computer seemed like a black box of
   unimaginable hollywood level 'hacking power' and that's partially by the level of intelligence needed to fully
   understand these concepts without the aid of search engines and outside opinions at a moments notice.
