# Assingment 3 (Linked Queue)
## Max Chase


### Time complexity analysis:

Given the hint, that operations not having to do with the structure as O(1), I would think that all three methods will have a constant time complexity O(1). They all perform a fixed number of operations regardless of the input; the operations performed by the methods only accoess and modify the first/last nodes of the list, which remains constant as the size of the list increases.

### Requirements:

1. Uses a linked-list to store values in the queue:
-
